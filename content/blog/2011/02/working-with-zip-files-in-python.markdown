Working with ZIP files in Python is pretty easy. Just import the <Code class="prettyprint">zipfile</code> module, and you're pretty much done.

Hereâ€™s some sample code:

<pre class="prettyprint">import zipfile
myzip = zipfile.ZipFile("something.zip")
file_list = myzip.namelist()
file_data = [myzip.read(filename) for filename in file_list]
</pre>

Just import the module, open the zip, get a file list out, and then you have a list containing all the data in each of the files. Pretty nifty, isn't it?
