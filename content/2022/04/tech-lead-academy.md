A few years ago (~2016) I had the opportunity to take a course from [Kent Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck) on how to become a tech lead. This was at a time when I was still very heavily focused on individual work and looking to grow; and a lot of the lessons now make a lot more sense in hindsight. I thought I'd write about it and reflect upon the parts of the advice that stood the test of time.

Since the course was fairly long (a full day), I've split up the content into three posts, one for each session:

* [Impact through Influence](/blog/2022/04/impact-through-influence/)
* 7 habits of highly effective tech leads (post to come soon)
* Project management & tech leads (post to come soon)

Each post is mostly a lightly edited version of my raw notes - I've held back on adding in my own thoughts/commentary, so this can be a more accurate representation of the course material. There will hopefully be a follow up series at some point covering my own experience here.
